# chaapo

we all entered the campus wiht a smile on our faces, scared yet excited of the unknown. Me and my team members being tech enthusiast were mostly holed up in a room and
exploring and learning new tech. There were times when we got hungry and decided to leave the fort and go to the canteen, but wait what should we eat. This simple question baffled me
and my Friends for ages unitl now. 

We decided to do something about it. 

we present to you CHAAPO....

our idea was basically to help the freshers and the seniors get and try the best food of the best canteens. No more wasting hours trying to decide what to eat and what not to

The journey..

we learnt loads of new things during the process. From trying to make the website responsive for that wierd shaped device to falling in love with Javascript. 
The website basically encompasses the data of all the canteens and also has a rating feature so that the users can guide as well as be guided about the new popular dish
in the town. We faced a ton of roadblocks though, but stackoverflow new turned its back on us :) , not to forget the enormous help we got from our seniors. 

Tech Stack

we have used the following in our website :-

1. HTML, CSS
2. Bootstrap
3. Javascript
4. Node js
5. Express js
7. ejs
6. MongoDb


Future scope :- 

we basically or looking to upscale our project in the future, thus including stationary and barber shops as well. I guess you all know just how much better the stationary
and the barber of RKB are than of RJB. We didn't :( But the next years fachhas will :) 

In terms of Tech stack, we will including React in our project thus encompassing MERN.
